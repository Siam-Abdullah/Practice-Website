        <p class="paragraph">
          World War II or the Second World War, often abbreviated as WWII or
          WW2, was a global conflict that lasted from 1939 to 1945. The vast
          majority of the world's countries, including all of the great powers,
          fought as part of two opposing military alliances: the Allies and the
          Axis. Many participants threw their economic, industrial, and
          scientific capabilities behind this total war, blurring the
          distinction between civilian and military resources. Aircraft played a
          major role, enabling the strategic bombing of population centres and
          the delivery of the only two nuclear weapons ever used in war. World
          War II was by far the deadliest conflict in history, resulting in an
          estimated 70 to 85 million fatalities, mostly among civilians. Tens of
          millions died due to genocides (including the Holocaust), starvation,
          massacres, and disease. In the wake of the Axis defeat, Germany and
          Japan were occupied, and war crimes tribunals were conducted against
          German and Japanese leaders. The causes of World War II are debated,
          but contributing factors included the Second Italo-Ethiopian War,
          Spanish Civil War, Second Sino-Japanese War, Soviet–Japanese border
          conflicts, the rise of fascism in Europe, and European tensions in the
          aftermath of World War I. World War II is generally considered to have
          begun on 1 September 1939, when Nazi Germany, under Adolf Hitler,
          invaded Poland. The United Kingdom and France subsequently declared
          war on Germany on 3 September. Under the Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact of
          August 1939, Germany and the Soviet Union had partitioned Poland and
          marked out their "spheres of influence" across Finland, Estonia,
          Latvia, Lithuania and Romania. From late 1939 to early 1941, in a
          series of campaigns and treaties, Germany conquered or controlled much
          of continental Europe, in a military alliance with Italy, Japan and
          other countries called the Axis. Following the onset of campaigns in
          North Africa and East Africa, and the fall of France in mid-1940, the
          war continued primarily between the European Axis powers and the
          British Empire, with war in the Balkans, the aerial Battle of Britain,
          the Blitz of the United Kingdom, and the Battle of the Atlantic. On 22
          June 1941, Germany led the European Axis powers in an invasion of the
          Soviet Union, opening the Eastern Front, the largest land theatre of
          war in history. Japan, which aimed to dominate Asia and the Pacific,
          was at war with the Republic of China by 1937. In December 1941, Japan
          attacked American and British territories with near-simultaneous
          offensives against Southeast Asia and the Central Pacific, including
          an attack on the U.S. fleet at Pearl Harbor which resulted in the
          United States and United Kingdom declaring war against Japan. The
          European Axis powers declared war on the United States in solidarity.
          Japan soon captured much of the western Pacific, but its advances were
          halted in 1942 after losing the critical Battle of Midway; later,
          Germany and Italy were defeated in North Africa and at Stalingrad in
          the Soviet Union. Key setbacks in 1943—including a series of German
          defeats on the Eastern Front, the Allied invasions of Sicily and the
          Italian mainland, and Allied offensives in the Pacific—cost the Axis
          powers their initiative and forced them into strategic retreat on all
          fronts. In 1944, the Western Allies invaded German-occupied France,
          while the Soviet Union regained its territorial losses and pushed
          Germany and its allies back. During 1944 and 1945, Japan suffered
          reversals in mainland Asia, while the Allies crippled the Japanese
          Navy and captured key western Pacific islands. The war in Europe
          concluded with the liberation of German-occupied territories and the
          invasion of Germany by the Western Allies and the Soviet Union,
          culminating in the Fall of Berlin to Soviet troops, Hitler's suicide,
          and the German unconditional surrender on 8 May 1945. Following the
          refusal of Japan to surrender on the terms of the Potsdam Declaration
          (issued 26 July 1945), the United States dropped the first atomic
          bombs on the Japanese cities of Hiroshima on 6 August and Nagasaki on
          9 August. Faced with an imminent invasion of the Japanese archipelago,
          the possibility of additional atomic bombings, and the Soviet Union's
          declared entry into the war against Japan on the eve of invading
          Manchuria, Japan announced on 10 August its intention to surrender,
          signing a surrender document on 2 September 1945. World War II changed
          the political alignment and social structure of the globe and set the
          foundation for the international order of the world's nations for the
          rest of the 20th century and into the present day. The United Nations
          was established to foster international co-operation and prevent
          future conflicts, with the victorious great powers—China, France, the
          Soviet Union, the United Kingdom, and the United States—becoming the
          permanent members of its Security Council. The Soviet Union and the
          United States emerged as rival superpowers, setting the stage for the
          nearly half-century-long Cold War. In the wake of European
          devastation, the influence of its great powers waned, triggering the
          decolonisation of Africa and Asia. Most countries whose industries had
          been damaged moved towards economic recovery and expansion. Political
          and economic integration, especially in Europe, began as an effort to
          forestall future hostilities, end pre-war enmities, and forge a sense
          of common identity.

        <p class="paragraph">
          It is generally considered that, in Europe, World War II started on 1
          September 1939,[1][2] beginning with the German invasion of Poland and
          the United Kingdom and France's declaration of war on Germany two days
          later on 3 September 1939. Dates for the beginning of the Pacific War
          include the start of the Second Sino-Japanese War on 7 July
          1937,[3][4] or the earlier Japanese invasion of Manchuria, on 19
          September 1931.[5][6] Others follow the British historian A. J. P.
          Taylor, who held that the Sino-Japanese War and war in Europe and its
          colonies occurred simultaneously, and the two wars became World War II
          in 1941.[7] Other starting dates sometimes used for World War II
          include the Italian invasion of Abyssinia on 3 October 1935.[8] The
          British historian Antony Beevor views the beginning of World War II as
          the Battles of Khalkhin Gol fought between Japan and the forces of
          Mongolia and the Soviet Union from May to September 1939.[9] Others
          view the Spanish Civil War as the start or prelude to World War
          II.[10][11] The exact date of the war's end is also not universally
          agreed upon. It was generally accepted at the time that the war ended
          with the armistice of 15 August 1945 (V-J Day), rather than with the
          formal surrender of Japan on 2 September 1945, which officially ended
          the war in Asia. A peace treaty between Japan and the Allies was
          signed in 1951.[12] A 1990 treaty regarding Germany's future allowed
          the reunification of East and West Germany to take place and resolved
          most post–World War II issues.[13] No formal peace treaty between
          Japan and the Soviet Union was ever signed,[14] although the state of
          war between the two countries was terminated by the Soviet–Japanese
          Joint Declaration of 1956, which also restored full diplomatic
          relations between them
